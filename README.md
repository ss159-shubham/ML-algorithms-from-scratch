# 💻 Machine Learning From Scratch

A personal repository where I implement core machine learning algorithms **from the ground up** using only `NumPy` — no high-level libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`. The goal is to understand the math and mechanics behind each model deeply.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo is a **learning project** for:
- Building foundational understanding of **ML algorithms**
- Gaining confidence in algorithm implementation without relying on black-box libraries

---

## 📚 What’s Included

This repository is organized in a layered approach:

### ✅ 1. Data Generation & Utilities
- `data_generator.py`: Create synthetic datasets for testing regressors
- `train_test_split`, `shuffle_data`, `metrics` like `MSE`

### ✅ 2. Core ML Algorithms

#### 🔷 Linear Models
- `Linear Regression` 
- `Polynomial Regression`
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Perceptron`

#### 🌲 Tree-Based Models
- `Decision Tree`
- `Random Forest`
- `Gradient Boosting`
- `XGBoost`

#### 📍 Instance-Based
- `K-Nearest Neighbors`

#### 🧩 Dimensionality Reduction
- `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`

#### 🧠 Reinforcement Learning
- `Tabular Q Learning`

#### 🧠 Neural Models
- `Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)`
- `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)`
- `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)`
